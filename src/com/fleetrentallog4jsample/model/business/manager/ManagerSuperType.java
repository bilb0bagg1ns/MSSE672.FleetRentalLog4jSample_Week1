    	* FAQ: How to pass in Properties file to app while I'm testing?
    	* 
    	* Answer:
    	*   		 
        * If using ANT:
    	* ============
    	* Property file is located by making a call to
		* System.getProperty(prop_location), which actually
		* reads off from the target runTestDriver in build.xml
		*   <sysproperty key="prop_location" value="${prop.dir}application.properties"/>
    	*
    	* If running in Eclipse 
    	* ===================== 
    	* 
    	* Right click on the unit test and navigate to
    	*       1. Run As -> Run Configuration
    	*       2. Select Arguments Tab
    	*       3. In VM Arguments section, add the -D property 
    	* 	           -Dprop_location=<drive><location>\application.properties
    	*            Example:
    	* 	           -Dprop_location=E:\FleetRental\config\application.properties
        *
    	* If running in NetBeans
    	* ===================== 
    	* 
    	* Right click on the unit test and navigate to
    	*       1. Run -> Set Project Configuration -> Customize
    	*       3. In VM Options section, add the -D property 
    	* 	           -Dprop_location=<drive><location>\application.properties
    	*            Example:
    	* 	           -Dprop_location=E:\FleetRental\config\application.properties
        *
        * 
    	* If running on command line 
    	* ==========================
    	* you'd pass in the above -D option with the java command.
